# PythonUnit-converter
A very tedious unit converter with python that I just built to get my python skills on board and get my hands dirty with python and to keep the pythonista blood flowing through my veins.
- Nothing fancy to see here
- Nothing impressive
- Just a python unit converter

*not memory efficient btw*
